        <div>About the research study:</div>

        We are a group of researchers at Stanford HCI Group conducting a study on the new crowd platform developed by us
        –
        Daemo. As part of the study, you’ll join in as a requester or a worker and perform a few tasks to test the
        features
        of the platform. We expect a total of three to five hours of your time.

        <div>General:</div>
        Daemo a new crowdsourcing marketplace designed to re­establish trust among workers and requesters. As any other
        crowdsourcing marketplace, Daemo allows requesters to post tasks, and allows workers to complete these tasks in
        exchange of payment. However, governed jointly by requesters and workers alike, Daemo’s prototyping process and
        reputation engine were designed to facilitate the collaboration that puts the relationship on a common ground.
        With
        requesters and workers sharing the same mental model of the intake and assessment of work, the computational
        predictability needed to ensure systemic wellness is in place.

        <div>Data Collection and Privacy Policy:</div>
        Participation in testing Daemo is voluntary, and you will not be penalized or lose benefits if you refuse to
        participate or decide to stop. We will not collect any identifying information about you, without obtaining your
        explicit consent. We may publish aggregate patterns of rating and process (in a scholarly research venue) or
        exemplar contest entries that do not reveal the identity of participants. Also, we may follow­up with random
        individuals, to understand their experience with the platform via an online survey.

        <div>Benefits:</div>
        Requester: As a requester, we appreciate your time to participate for this effort. We expect a total of thirty
        minutes to five hours of your time ­ and you may be compensated up to $50 for your contributions. Overall, you
        get
        first hard experience and say to the next generation crowd platform designed to amplify trust in crowd work.
        This
        has potentially huge impact to society, as more people try to find work online and similar marketplaces; and
        more
        work gets generated via such platforms ­ the need of a better crowd market place is going to increase. With
        improved
        trust, higher quality work and satisfaction will make the ecosystem viable and attract larger participation.


        <div>Risk and Discomforts:</div>
        We anticipate no significant risks and no discomfort while you're participating in this program. You may request
        researchers to delete any data of yours from the research experiment at any time for any reason. As part of our
        research, in publications, we will make sure to exclude any information that can lead to identification of
        individuals, unless we have an explicit permission from you.
        If you find any part of the study uncomfortable or risky, you’re free to pause or stop participating. You’ll be
        compensated for the time and work you contributed.

        <div>Understanding Participation Rules:</div>
        By participating in this program, you agree that you understand (via website or email interaction with the
        organizers): (i) the purposes, procedures, and duration of the research; (ii) any procedures which are
        experimental;
        (iii) any reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, and benefits of the research; (iv) any
