  <div>About the research study:</div>

  We are a group of researchers at Stanford HCI Group conducting a study on the new crowd platform developed by us
  –
  Daemo. As part of the study, you’ll join in as a requester or a worker and perform a few tasks to test the
  features
  of the platform. We expect a total of three to five hours of your time.

  <div>General:</div>
  Daemo a new crowdsourcing marketplace designed to re­establish trust among workers and requesters. As any other
  crowdsourcing marketplace, Daemo allows requesters to post tasks, and allows workers to complete these tasks in
  exchange of payment. However, governed jointly by requesters and workers alike, Daemo’s prototyping process and
  reputation engine were designed to facilitate the collaboration that puts the relationship on a common ground.
  With
  requesters and workers sharing the same mental model of the intake and assessment of work, the computational
  predictability needed to ensure systemic wellness is in place.

  <div>Data Collection and Privacy Policy:</div>
  Participation in testing Daemo is voluntary, and you will not be penalized or lose benefits if you refuse to
  participate or decide to stop. We will not collect any identifying information about you, without obtaining your
  explicit consent. We may publish aggregate patterns of rating and process (in a scholarly research venue) or
  exemplar contest entries that do not reveal the identity of participants. Also, we may follow­up with random
  individuals, to understand their experience with the platform via an online survey.

  <div>Benefits:</div>
  Requester: As a requester, we appreciate your time to participate for this effort. We expect a total of thirty
  minutes to five hours of your time ­ and you may be compensated up to $50 for your contributions. Overall, you
  get
  first hard experience and say to the next generation crowd platform designed to amplify trust in crowd work.
  This
  has potentially huge impact to society, as more people try to find work online and similar marketplaces; and
  more
  work gets generated via such platforms ­ the need of a better crowd market place is going to increase. With
  improved
  trust, higher quality work and satisfaction will make the ecosystem viable and attract larger participation.


  <div>Risk and Discomforts:</div>
  We anticipate no significant risks and no discomfort while you're participating in this program. You may request
  researchers to delete any data of yours from the research experiment at any time for any reason. As part of our
  research, in publications, we will make sure to exclude any information that can lead to identification of
  individuals, unless we have an explicit permission from you.
  If you find any part of the study uncomfortable or risky, you’re free to pause or stop participating. You’ll be
  compensated for the time and work you contributed.
